# My Memorandum
_Navigating myself with the canvas of every tear and smile into blank pages of an open book.
Sometimes emptiness, sometimes clarity, sometimes my experience paints a new chapter of my existence embracing my emotions. Discovering the power of emotions on the unwritten pages of my life act as fuel and provide a compass for my next step but sometimes these emotional navigation falters leading astray. 
Despite of such deviations, valuable lessons have scribed into my pages._

## Special CreditsðŸ’›
I am not really a social butterfly and on several occasions I turn up rude. But I have people who love and take care of me despite all that. Still here are the following few who have reserved a special place both in my life and my heart.
